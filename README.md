# nanoKontrol
TouchDesigner

Hello,
That's the new version of my TD device for Korg nanoKontrol2
You need first to reaffect the fader and buttons with the Korg Editor using the nanoKontrol.nktrl2_data file available here
Normaly you can use it as directly
- there is two chop output, one gives you the left side of the Korg, other the right part
- you can change the labels entering a table in the DAT input
- you can change the value in the container feeding the Chop input
- you can change the position of fader/knob without changing the output if you press the "set" button

I am in the process of writing a real manual but I need a little time :-)
